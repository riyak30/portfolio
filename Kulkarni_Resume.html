            <h4>Career Goal</h4>
            <p>When I am older, I want to go into the field of engineering or computer science 
            because this field is very interesting and technology is going
            to be very crucial in the future. </p>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. I am enrolled 
            in a class called Computer Science Principles which focuses on the 
            different languages of computer science. Some colleges that I am 
            interested in are Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, 
            Harvard University, Georgia Institute of Technology and Berkeley 
            because these colleges provide a good education on computer science. </p>
            <h4>Work/Volunteer Experience</h4>
            <p>Currently, I am too young to volunteer or get a job, however over
            the next summer, I plan to work at places such as T4 to get 
            work experience. In addition, I plan to volunteer/work at 
            places like cisco to get a chance to see what a job that revolves 
            around computer science is like. </p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <p>Some skills that I have that can help me succeed in the field of 
            computer science are that I know how to code in a variety of different 
            languages such as python, HTML, Java and JavaScript and I know how 
            to code in a lot of different programs such as Cloud 9, Mit App 
            Inventor, Scratch and GitHub. I earned the knowledge of how to code in 
            different languages and different programs because I took 
            a number of computer science courses in and outside of school. </p>
            <h4>Languages</h4>
            <p>I am fluent in both english and marathi (an indian language). At 
            home, I speak fluent marathi and english to my parents. In addition,
            I am learning spanish in school currently and I am almost fluent in 
            it.</p>
            <h4>Extra Curricular Activities</h4>
            <p>Some extracurricular activities that I participate in are 
            basketball, dance and violin. I am on the junior varsity basketball
            team at Dublin High School and I also do many more basketball leagues 
            outside of school. Basketball really helps me 
            demonstrate leadership because I am usually the point guard during 
            games, so I have to communicate with all of my teammates and tell 
            them which plays to run. Furthermore, I have been playing the 
            violin for almost 4 years now. I am also in the photography club at 
            Dublin High School where we travel around the Bay Area taking photos
            at places such as Walnut Creek and San Francisco. Last but not least, I 
            have been doing dance for about 3 years now. This helps me display 
            leadership because I have to motivate my peers during practices and 
            performances. I also help with choroegraphing most of the dances which
            helps me demonstrate leadership to both my peers and my teacher. </p>
