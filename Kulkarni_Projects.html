                        project was to make a challenging and fun game that included 
                        a variety of obstacles. For our game, Mole Mash, the 
                        objective of the game was to tap the mole as it moved 
                        around the screen. At a specific level, another mole 
                        would appear on the screen, however, this mole wasn't 
                        supposed to be tapped. If this mole was tapped, the 
                        score would decrease. In addition, the user was able to 
                        change the speed of the mole as it moved around the 
                        screen. My role in this project 
                        was to do the documentation, think of 
                        ideas on how we could improve our game and write some 
                        of the code for our game. I learned many new 
                        things throughout this project. I learned how to code 
                        in Mit App inventor, how to create different levels
                        and how to add more designs and sprites in a game. 
                        In addition, I also learned how 
                        to make a sprite appear on the screen at a certain point
                        in the game and I improved on writing documentation; 
                        I made the documentation very organized
                        and thorough. However, I also ran into many
                        challenges throughout this project such as fixing the
                        glitches in the game; sometimes both of the moles would 
                        land on the same spot on the screen which was a very 
                        hard glitch to fix. I couldn't of finished this 
                        project without my partner; Omer Ahmer. We both divided 
                        the work equally, so we would be able to finish the 
                        project in the time given. He worked on the code, while 
                        I worked on the documentation and then we switched so 
                        that we both would have a chance to experiment with
                        different things on App Inventor and we both could be able to add 
                        our ideas and skills to the game. </p>

                        <p class="card-text-canter">The objective of this project 
                        was to create a simple hangman game using python. In our 
                        game, the user's job was to guess the secret word in the 
                        number of guesses given. We also added a theme of disney
                        movies, so each secret word was the name of a disney movie. 
                        My role in this project was to come up with different words that could be 
                        used for the user to guess and to write the code for this game.
                        For example, I had to write many if, elif and else 
                        statements for the user's responses. In addition, I had
                        to write code so that dashes would show up in place of the 
                        un-guessed letters. Throughout this project, I learned
                        many new algorithms and functions in python; I learned
                        how to use if, elif and else statements properly, how to 
                        randomly sort words, and how to create a specific amount of guesses that 
                        decrease after each response. However, throughout this
                        process, we ran into many challenges. For instance, sometimes 
                        the number of guesses would glitch and it would keep on 
                        replaying the same guess over and over again. To fix this, 
                        we had to change the code, so that the number of guesses
                        would decrease after each turn. Furthermore, in order
                        for this project to be completed, there was a lot of team 
                        dynamic required; I focused on writing the code, while
                        my partner, Michelle Li focused on coming up with words
                        that we could use for our game. Additionally, Michelle also
                        helped me fix any errors or glicthes that we had in the code.</p>
