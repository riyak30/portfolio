                        <p class="card-text-canter">The objective of this 
                        project was to make a challenging and fun that included 
                        a variety of obstacles. For our game, Mole Mash, the 
                        objective of the game was to tap on the mole as it moved 
                        around the screen. At a specific level, another mole 
                        would appear on the screen, however this mole wasn't 
                        supposed to be tapped. If this mole was tapped, the 
                        score would decease. In addition, the speed of the 
                        mole's could be adjusted too. My role in this project 
                        was to do the documentation of the project, think of 
                        ideas on how we could improve our game and create part 
                        of the code for our game. I learned many different 
                        things throughout this project. I learned how to code 
                        in Mit App inventor, I learned how to manage my time 
                        better and I learned a lot of new skills such as how 
                        to create different levels and how to add more designs
                        and sprites in a game. In addition, I also learned how 
                        to make a sprite appear on the screen at a certain point
                        in the game and I improved on writing the documentation 
                        for our website. I made the documentation very organized
                        and thorough. However, I also ran into a 
                        lot of challenges during this project such as fixing the
                        glitches in the game; sometimes both of the moles would 
                        land on the same spot on the screen which was a very 
                        hard glitch to fix. I couldn't of finished this 
                        project without my partner; Omer Ahmer. We both divided 
                        the work equally, so we would be able to finish the 
                        project in the time given. He worked on the code, while 
                        I worked on the documentation and then we switched, so 
                        that we both would have the chance to experiment with
                        different things on App Inventor and we could both add 
                        our ideas and skills to the game. </p>
