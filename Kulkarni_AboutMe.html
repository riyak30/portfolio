                        <p class="card-text-center"> Computer science is the 
                        theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the
                        basis for the design and use of computers. The only 
                        reason you are able to see this website right now is 
                        because of the complex and interesting field of computer
                        science. My name is Riya Kulkarni and I am currently a
                        student at Dublin High School taking the course of 
                        Computer Science Principles. Ever since middle school, 
                        I have always been intrigued by computer science. 
                        When I am older, I want to become an engineer where I 
                        can learn to develop solutions about technical problems.
                        Engineering interests me because my dad is an engineer,
                        so he is always pushing me to go into the field of 
                        computer science because of how fascinating it is. </p>

                        <p class="card-text-center"> Some characteristics about 
                        me are that I am a very social and interactive person. 
                        Whether I am working on a project with my peers or 
                        playing basketball with my teammates, I am a very 
                        positive, innovative, open-minded, resourceful and 
                        supportive person. I am always encouraging people and I
                        am always open to others ideas. In addition, I always 
                        try my hardest no matter what I am doing. Furthermore, in 
                        basketball, I am always communicating with others and 
                        supporting my teammates throughout practices and games. 
                        At school, I also interact with my peers and push them 
                        to do there best. Something that I have learned from 
                        myself is that I never give up. This year, I took the 
                        class Computer Science Principles which is a very 
                        difficult class, however, I never gave up, no matter how
                        hard it was. The material was very confusing to 
                        understand, but I always asked questions when I didnâ€™t 
                        understand something and I would always complete all of
                        my work, even if it was difficult. In addition, in 
                        basketball, I also learned that I never give up. When I 
                        am playing in games and we are losing, I always push 
                        through and try my hardest to win the game, no matter 
                        how tired I am. If I end up losing, I practice more and 
                        try even harder the next game.</p>
                        <p class="card-text-center">Some of my major 
                        achievements at Dublin High School are making the girls
                        basketball team and maintaining all of my grades while 
                        juggling with all of my extra curricular activities. 
                        Currently, I am in the Photography Club, Girls 
                        Basketball Team, Mukbang Club and The Smile Club. These 
                        activities keep me involved with the school and my peers.
                        In conclusion, I am very excited to grow and learn more
                        information about computer science. I hope that one day
                        I can become an engineer and develop technology </p>
