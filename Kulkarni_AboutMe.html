            <p>Computer science is the theory, experimentation, 
                       and engineering that form the basis for the design and 
                       use of computers. The only reason you are able to see this 
                       website right now is because of the complex and interesting 
                       field of computer science. My name is Riya Kulkarni and I
                       am currently a student at Dublin High School taking the 
                       course of Computer Science Principles. Ever since middle 
                       school, I have always been intrigued by computer science. 
                       When I am older, I want to become an engineer where I 
                       can learn to develop solutions about technical problems.
                       Engineering interests me because my dad is an engineer,
                       so he is always pushing me to go into the field of 
                       computer science because of how fascinating it is. I plan
                       to grow in computer science by taking a lot more courses
                       on computer science at school and outside of school. </p>
                       <p> Some characteristics about 
                        me are that I am a very social and interactive person. 
                        Whether I am working on a project with my peers or 
                        playing basketball with my teammates, I am a very 
                        positive, innovative, open-minded, resourceful and 
                        supportive person. I am always encouraging people and I
                        am always open to others ideas. In addition, I always 
                        try my hardest no matter what I am doing. Furthermore, in 
                        basketball, I am always communicating with others and 
                        supporting my teammates throughout practices and games. 
                        At school, I also interact with my peers and push them 
                        to do there best. Something that I have learned from 
                        myself is that I never give up. This year, I chose to 
                        take the class Computer Science Principles, which is a very 
                        difficult class, however, I keep on persevering, no matter how
                        hard it is. The material is very confusing to 
                        understand, but I always asked questions when I don't
                        understand something and I am always completing all of
                        my work, even if it is difficult. In addition, in 
                        basketball, I also learned that I never give up. When I 
                        am playing in games and we are losing, I always push 
                        through and try my hardest to win the game, no matter 
                        how tired I am. However, If we do end up losing, 
                        I practice more and try even harder in the next game, so
                        we won't end up losing again. </p>
                        <p>Some of my major 
                        achievements at Dublin High School are making the girls
                        basketball team and maintaining all of my grades while 
                        juggling with all of my extra curricular activities. 
                        Currently, I am in the Photography Club, Girls 
                        Basketball Team, and The Smile Club. These 
                        activities keep me involved with the school and my peers.
                        In conclusion, I am very excited to learn more
                        information about computer science. I hope that one day
                        I can be an engineer and grow in the field of computer 
                        science. I am very glad I got to share to you about 
                        myself. If you want to continue reading, click below. </p>
