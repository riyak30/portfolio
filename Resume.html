            <h4>Career Goal</h4>
            <p>When I am older, I want to go into the field of computer science 
            because it really interests me. </p>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. I am enrolled 
            in a class called Computer Science Principles which focuses on the 
            different languages of computer science. Some colleges that I am 
            interested in are Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, 
            Harvard University, Georgia Institute of Technology and Berkeley 
            because these colleges provide a good education on computer science. </p>
            <h4>Work/Volunteer Experience</h4>
            <p>Currently, I am too young to volunteer or get a job, however over
            the next summer, I plan to volunteer at places such as T4 to get 
            volunteer experience. In addition, I plan to volunteer/work at 
            places like cisco to get a chance to see what a job that revolves 
            around computer science is like. </p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <p>Some skills that I have that can help me succeed in the field of 
            computer science are that I can communicate with others well and I 
            know how to code in a variety of different languages such as python,
            HTML, Java and JavaScript. For example, over the summer of 2018, I 
            took two courses at Stanford University for java and artificial 
            intelligence. </p>
            <h4>Languages</h4>
            <p>I am fluent in both english and marathi (an indian language). At 
            home, I speak fluent marathi and english to my parents. In addition,
            I am learning spanish in school right now and I am almost fluent in 
            it.</p>
            <h4>Extra Curricular Activites</h4>
            <p>Some extracurricular activities that I participate in are 
            basketball, dance and violin. I am on the junior varsity basketball
            team at Dublin High School and I also do more basketball leagues in
            addition to the school basketball team. Basketball really helps me 
            demonstrate leadership because I am usually the point guard during 
            games, so I have to communicate with all of my teammates and tell 
            them which plays to run. Furthermore,  I have been playing the 
            violin for almost 4 years now. I am also in the photography club at 
            Dublin High School where we travel around the bay area taking photos
            of places like Walnut Creek or San Francisco. Last but not least, I 
            have been doing dance for about 3 years now. This helps me display 
            leadership because I have to motivate my peers during practices and 
            performances.</p>
