                        <p class="card-text-canter">The objective of this 
                        project was to make a challenging and fun that included 
                        a variety of obstacles. For our game, Mole Mash, the 
                        objective of the game was to tap on the mole as it moved 
                        around the screen. At a specific level, another mole 
                        would appear on the screen, however this mole wasn't 
                        supposed to be tapped. If this mole was tapped, the 
                        score would decease. In addition, the speed of the 
                        mole's could be adjusted too. My role in this project 
                        was to do the documentation of the project, think of 
                        ideas on how we could improve our game and create part 
                        of the code for our game. I learned many different 
                        things thorughout this project. I learned how to code 
                        in Mit App inventor, I learned how to manage my time 
                        better and I learned a lot of new skills such as how 
                        to create different levels. However, I also ran into a 
                        lot of challenges during this project such as fixing the
                        glitches in the game; sometimes both of the moles would 
                        land on the same spot which was a very hard glitch to 
                        fix. However, I couldn't of finished this project 
                        without my partner. We both divided the work, so we 
                        would be able to finish the project in the time given. 
                        He worked on the code, while I worked on the 
                        documentation and then we switched, so that both partners 
                        would have the chance to experiment different things.</p>
